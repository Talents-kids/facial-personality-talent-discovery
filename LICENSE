1. DEFINITIONS

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and

      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram in which the Work is
      recited or otherwise performed. For purposes of this Public
      License, where the Work is a musical work, composition, or

   c. "Attribute" or "Attribution" means to credit the author, creator,
      and/or licensor of the Work in the manner specified by that author,

   f. "Effective Technological Measures" means those measures that, in
      the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under
      laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
      Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
      international agreements.

      License with the same License Elements.

   o. "Sui Generis Database Rights" means rights other than copyright
      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

2. SCOPE

   a. License Grant.
      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
      Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise
      the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
      1. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
      2. produce, reproduce, and Share Adaptations of the Licensed
         Material.

   b. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License
      does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
      conditions.

   c. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

   d. Media and formats; technical modifications. The Licensor authorizes
      You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether
      now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications
      necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
      any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
      modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures.

   e. Downstream recipients.

      1. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient
         of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from
         the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms
         and conditions of this Public License.

      2. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Licensor
         offers to license the Licensed Material subject to the terms and
         conditions of this Public License.

      3. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
         additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
         Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
         doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
         recipient of the Licensed Material.

   f. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
      construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
      Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
      endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
      designated to receive attribution.

      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
         reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in

         offer terms or conditions that restrict the recipient's exercise
         of the rights granted hereunder.

      3. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
         You must not remove, alter, or obscure any notice of this Public

         By-SA Compatible License applies, You may substitute that notice
         with the notice of the later version of this Public License or
         By-SA Compatible License provided that You comply with the terms
         and conditions of the later version of this Public License or
         By-SA Compatible License.

4. SUI GENERIS DATABASE RIGHTS

   Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
   apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
      extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of
      the contents of the database, provided You do not Share a Sui
      Generis Database Rights Protected collection of contents. However,
      if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
      in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then
      the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not
      its individual contents) is Sui Generis Database Rights Protected.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT
      POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND
      AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
      CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
      STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
      OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,

      CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS,
      EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF
      THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES.

   b. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART,
      THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

7. TERM AND TERMINATION

   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Related
      Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
      License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
      automatically.

   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 7(a), it reinstates:

      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
         cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of
      this Public License.

   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
      Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the

   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
      Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the
      terms and conditions of this Public License.

   c. If any provision of this Public License is held to be invalid or
      unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make it valid and enforceable. If such provision cannot be so
      reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without
      affecting the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.

   d. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed by the
      Licensor.

   e. This Public License constitutes the entire agreement between You and
      the Licensor with respect to the Licensed Material. If any provision
      of this Public License is held to be unenforceable, the parties
      consent to reformation to make such provision enforceable. If no such
      reformation is possible, the provision shall be severed with the
      remaining provisions continuing in full force and effect.
